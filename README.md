# AI-Little-Go

## Overview
This repository contains the second CSCI-561 AI programming assignment, where the primary focus is developing AI agents to play a simplified version of Go (Little-Go or Go-5x5) using the MiniMax algorithm. The project aims to demonstrate the efficacy of MiniMax in strategic board game scenarios.

## Game Description
Little-Go is a variant of the traditional Go game, played on a 5x5 grid. The objective is to capture more territory than the opponent, employing strategic placement of stones.

## Key Features
- AI agents developed specifically for Little-Go.
- Implementation of the MiniMax algorithm to make strategic decisions.
- Participation in simulated games to evaluate the effectiveness of the AI.

## Task Breakdown
1. **AI Agent Implementation**: Develop agents that use MiniMax for decision-making.
2. **Strategy and Gameplay**: Implement effective strategies for the AI agents.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Test agents in various game settings to assess strategy strength.
